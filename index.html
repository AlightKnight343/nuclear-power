                <h3>Fission</h3>
                <p class="glow">Fission reaction does not normally occur in nature<br><br>
                    Fission produces many highly radioactive particles <br><br>
                    The energy released by fission is a million times greater than that released in chemical reactions; but lower than the energy released by nuclear fusion<br><br>
                    One class of nuclear weapon is a fission bomb, also known as an atomic bomb or atom bomb<br><br>
                    Fission is the splitting of a large atom into two or more smaller ones<br><br>
                    Critical mass of the substance and high-speed neutrons are required<br><br>
                    Takes little energy to split two atoms in a fission reaction</p>

                <h3>Fusion</h3>
                <p class="glow">Fusion occurs in stars, such as the sun<br><br>
                    Few radioactive particles are produced by fusion reaction, but if a fission “trigger” is used, radioactive particles will result from that<br><br>
                    The energy released by fusion is three to four times greater than the energy released by fission<br><br>
                    One class of nuclear weapon is the hydrogen bomb, which uses a fission reaction to “trigger” a fusion reaction<br><br>
                    Fusion is the fusing of two or more lighter atoms into a larger one<br><br>
                    High density, high temperature environment is required<br><br>
                    Extremely high energy is required to bring two or more protons close enough that nuclear forces overcome their electrostatic repulsion
